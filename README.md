# CSAP_Rodinia_porting
SNU CSAP Lab UROP works



This is the modification of Rodinia benchmark 3.1.

Orignial benchmark link: http://rodinia.cs.virginia.edu/doku.php

Only OpenCL benchmarks are modified.

These modified ones use system memory instead of device memory as buffer.

Also, the kernels run on both CPU and GPU.
